Learn Solidity: Mastering Ethereum Development & Smart Contract Auditing

Welcome to my Learn Solidity repository! This is my structured journey to master Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contract development. My ultimate goal is to become proficient in Ethereum development and skilled in smart contract auditing.

Why Solidity?

Solidity is the backbone of decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains. With the rise of Web3, mastering Solidity is essential for creating secure and efficient decentralized solutions. Additionally, understanding Solidity at a deeper level is critical for identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring robust smart contract security.

My Learning Goals

Short-Term:

	â€¢	Build a solid foundation in Solidity, including its syntax, features, and concepts.
	â€¢	Develop and deploy basic to intermediate smart contracts.
	â€¢	Learn to identify and handle common Solidity vulnerabilities.

Long-Term:

	â€¢	Create advanced decentralized applications with Solidity.
	â€¢	Develop expertise in smart contract auditing to ensure security and prevent exploits.
	â€¢	Master Solidity hacking techniques to find and fix potential vulnerabilities.

Topics Covered

Hereâ€™s the structured roadmap for my journey:

1. Basics of Solidity

	â€¢	Variables (State, Local, and Global Variables)
	â€¢	Data Types (Value and Reference Types)
	â€¢	Functions (Visibility, Modifiers, and Return Types)
	â€¢	Error Handling (require, revert, assert, Custom Errors)

2. Intermediate Solidity

	â€¢	Arrays, Structs, and Mappings
	â€¢	Events and Logs
	â€¢	Inheritance and Interfaces
	â€¢	Access Control and Modifiers

3. Advanced Solidity

	â€¢	Smart Contract Deployment and Interaction
	â€¢	Payable Functions and Ether Transfers
	â€¢	Gas Optimization Techniques
	â€¢	Fallback and Receive Functions

4. Security in Solidity

	â€¢	Common Vulnerabilities (Reentrancy, Overflow/Underflow, Self-Destruct, etc.)
	â€¢	Best Practices for Writing Secure Smart Contracts
	â€¢	Auditing Techniques and Tools

5. Exploring Solidity Hacking

	â€¢	Testing and Exploiting Vulnerabilities
	â€¢	Simulating Attacks in Test Environments
	â€¢	Writing Secure Solidity Code to Prevent Exploits
